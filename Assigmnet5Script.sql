# HERE I write a SELECT statement that returns A column that uses the FORMAT function to return the list_price column with 2
#digits to the right of the decimal point, A column that uses the CAST function to return the discount_percent column as
#an integer, A column named discount_amount that uses the list_price and discount_percent, a columns to calculate the discount amount and uses the ROUND function to round
#the result so it has 2 decimal digits A column named month_day_added that uses the DATE_FORMAT function (as
#part of your solution) to return the date_added column in this format: MM-DD
